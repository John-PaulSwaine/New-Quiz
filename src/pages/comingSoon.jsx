            <br />
            <p>Over the coming months, we will be making changes to how you interact with us and our website. These changes include:</p>
            <h5>Daily, Weekly and Monthly Challenges.</h5>
            <p>After listening to user feedback, we have decided to gradually introduce daily, weekly, and monthly challenges. These challenges will feature scenario-based questions that require you to think quickly and demonstrate the actions you would take in various situations, including different types of cyber attacks.</p>
            <h5>A top 10 Leaderboard</h5>
            <p>After receiving requests from users to compare their scores with others, we have decided that our next update will include a Top 10 leaderboard. This feature will allow all users to see how they rank against one another. In the event of tied scores, the deciding factor will be the time taken to answer the questions.</p>
            <h5>An advice section</h5>
            <p>The update following the leaderboard will include a new page titled Advice. This page will offer tips to help users make themselves, their devices, and their networks a little more secure against cyberattack threats. While we do not claim that our advice will completely eliminate the risk—something we wouldn’t promise given the ever-changing nature of cybersecurity—it will help mitigate those risks. Additionally, our guidance aims to better protect important files, such as family photos, making it more difficult for cybercriminals to access what they want.</p>
